"""
Blockchain Consensus Algorithm Showcase.

A comprehensive demonstration of consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology,
built using patterns from the SWE Agent codebase (Pydantic models, modular architecture).

Algorithms implemented:
- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
